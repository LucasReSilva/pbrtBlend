LuxBlend25 architecture
-----------------------

This file attempts to explain, as an overview, how the LuxBlend25 addon is
built, and the purpose of the packages and files in the source tree. Whilst
this file attempts to describe in words the operation of the addon, you should
cross-reference each section against the code it talks about in order to gain
a better understanding of the system.


Custom properties
=================

When the addon is loaded, it creates a whole load of custom 'property groups'
in various types within Blender as a way to store custom properties for
LuxRender specific settings.

The property groups and the properties they contain are defined in the files
in the properties/ package. The property groups are defined by inheriting
from the declarative_property_group type found in the extensions_framework.
The 4 key class members used are 'controls', 'visibility' and 'properties', and
'ef_attach_to'.

The 'properties' member defines a list of properties in the group. Each
property has a type, attribute name (attr), UI name (name), description, and
perhaps also default/min/max values.

The 'controls' list defines the order of layout of the properties in a UI panel.
Items in a nested list are displayed on the same row, otherwise the panel is
drawn as a column. eg. ['a','b', ['c','d','e'], ['f','g']] would be drawn as:

 | a ------------ |
 | b ------------ |
 | c -- d -- e -- |
 | f ---- g ----- |

The 'visibility' dict allows the UI controls for properties to be displayed or
hidden depending on the value of other properties. eg. { 'a' : { 'b': True } }
can be interpreted as "only display property 'a' if the value of property 'b'
is True".

The 'ef_attach_to' is a list which specifies which data types the property
group should be "attached" to as a child. eg. the following class definition:

class MyPG(declarative_property_group):
	ef_attach_to = ['Scene', 'World']

will create bpy.types.Scene.MyPG and bpy.types.World.MyPG. Some property groups
are not attached to other types (eg. volume_data and light_group_data) since
they are used as members of a CollectionProperty in other property groups.

Most property groups also contain a method (usually named get_paramset()) which
formats its own properties into a LuxRender ParamSet, which is then either
written to file or passed to the integrated rendering context. Some property
groups (eg. for Materials and Textures) also have a load_paramset method which
does the reverse.


User Interface panels
=====================

Each UI panel is defined as a class in the ui/ package. Each panel class
inherits from property_group_renderer found in extensions_framework and uses
a member 'display_property_groups' to determine which property group to display
in the panel. Some panels also define their own poll() and draw() methods for
more direct control of when and how to display the panel.


Property and Panel initialisation
=================================

In order to get the custom property groups and panels loaded, they are first
imported in the core/ package. Importing UI modules alone is enough to register
the panel with Blender.

The mechanism which makes this work is the @PBRTv3Addon.addon_register_class
decorator. When the file the class is defined in is imported, the decorator
is executed and adds the class definition to a list containing all of the
classes which this addon should register in Blender. When the addon is
initialised by Blender, the classes are registered, and when the addon is
disabled, they are unregistered.

Operators
=========

LuxBlend25 also defines several Blender operators to perform tasks.
The most important one is EXPORT_OT_luxrender, which exports the current scene
to an .lxs file. This is registered as an operator in order to add it to the 
File -> Export menu. The actual implementation of the export process is defined
elsewhere (in the export/scene module).

Any operators in the operators/ package need to be imported into core/ in order
to be registered when the addon is loaded.

The core/ package is also responsible for telling Blender which other UI panels
are compatible with LuxRender.

RenderEngine
============

LuxBlend25 primarily registers itself as a Render Engine within Blender. The
RENDERENGINE_luxrender class in the core/ package is the implementation of
this interface. The render() method of that class is called when the user
presses the Render button in blender (or, more precisely, when Blender calls
it's bpy.ops.render.render() operator).

Note that at the present time, Blender makes no distinction to the RenderEngine
whether it is rendering a single frame, animation or a material preview. It is
RENDERENGINE_luxrender that has to do the guesswork and act accordingly.

The RENDERENGINE_luxrender class contains all the process-management needed to
run LuxRender either as an external process, or fully integrated via the pylux
python module. It uses the same scene-export process as is used by the
EXPORT_OT_luxrender operator.


How the Scene is exported
=========================

The output of data from Blender to LuxRender is abstracted through a lux_context
object. This object may be writing to file, or calling API methods on pylux.
It should not be assumed at any time that either of these methods is being used,
though occasionally checks need to be made in order to perform tasks specific
to one method or the other. The classes which implement the lux_context
interface are defined in the outputs/ package. In fact, the interface is the
same as the pylux.Context API - the file_api module emulates this in order to
write .lx* files.

The lbm2_api and lxm_api interfaces are simplified version of the file_api
interface which deal specifically with saving material, texture and volume
definitions to file.


The export process
==================

The process of exporting a Blender Scene to a lux_context starts in the export/
package. This package defines classes and functions which translate various
Blender objects/types into the format needed by LuxRender. The entire process
starts with export/scene. The SceneExporter class has an export() method,
which does the following:
* Check that the scene to be exported is valid
* Create a lux_context object the required type (file output or api calls)
* For file output, construct the correct file path and file names
* Export the render engine settings to the context (integrator, sampler etc)
* Export the Camera and Film settings
* Export the Volume (media) definitions, if any
* Export the Geometry (deferred to export/geometry)
* Export the (non-mesh) light sources (deferred to export/lights)

Most of these export processes call upon the custom property groups to return
an Identifier and a ParamSet to be passed to the lux_context using a method
usually named api_output(). Geometry and lights in particular defer to other
modules which perform additional tasks to export the correct items.

Note that no materials are explicitly exported here, they are exported as
needed from within the export/geometry module.


Geometry export
===============

The export/geometry module contains the majority of the useful code used in the
export process. It is responsible for detecting exportable meshes in the scene,
and translating them into LuxRender format Shapes. It also ensures that objects
with 'duplis' or particle systems enabled have all their child objects exported
as well.

The process starts with the iterateScene method of GeometryExporter. This
method loops over all the objects in the Scene, and passes anything interesting
to the GeometryExporter class callback methods, which then handles that object.


GeometryExporter
................

This class contains a set of methods which deal with converting certain Blender
objects into meshes. LuxRender also requires that meshes with multiple materials
assigned are split into separate parts. This class also deals with deciding
whether to export meshes as ObjectBegin..ObjectEnd/ObjectInstance definitions
for geometry instancing, or whether each mesh instance should be exported in full.
Material assignments for meshes are detected, and the materials are exported
as needed.

Further logic is performed in order to detect and override object instancing
for emitting objects, and for motion blurred objects.

An additional mesh-material part and object caching system is also implemented
in order to prevent processing the same data more than once per export.


Light source export
===================

The export/lights module iterates over the objects in the Scene and translates
all Lamp objects into light sources for LuxRender. The implementation is a
fairly simple loop in the lights() function.

Note that the geometry export has to be performed first, because of the Portals
system in LuxRender. Each light source exported needs to be told about Portal
mesh instances.


Material/Texture export
=======================

The entry point for exporting a material is in
properties/material/luxrender_material.export()

This method takes a lux_context and the parent Blender material as arguments
and exports the material, and its constituent textures and sub-materials to the
lux_context.

When called in 'direct' mode, the entire stack of materials and textures needed
to create this material are exported for every material, using the traditional
PRBT Texture/Material syntax. This mode is used when exporting in Internal mode
without writing to disk.

When called in 'indirect' mode, the system will use a caching mechanism to
ensure that each material and texture is not exported more than once. It will
also switch to using the Texture/MakeNamedMaterial/NamedMaterial syntax. This
system is used when writing scene files to disk, and allows the exporter to
put all the material and texture definitions into a dedicated file (the .lxm
file).

Similar to how materials are only exported on-demand from the objects that use
them, textures too are only exported on-demand by the materials that use them.
There is not a dedicated iterator which exports all textures in the scene 
(neither is there an iterator which exports all materials in the scene).
